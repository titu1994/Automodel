# Model Coverage Overview

NeMo AutoModel integrates with Hugging Face `transformers`. Any LLM or VLM that can be instantiated through `transformers` can also be used via NeMo AutoModel, subject to runtime, third-party software dependencies, and feature compatibility.

## Supported Hugging Face Auto Classes

| Auto Class | Task | Status | Details |
|------------|------|--------|---------|
| `AutoModelForCausalLM` | Text Generation (LLM) | Supported | See [LLM model list](llm/index.md). |
| `AutoModelForImageTextToText` | Image-Text-to-Text (VLM) | Supported | See [VLM model list](vlm/index.md). |
| `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` | Sequence Classification | WIP | Early support; interfaces may change. |
| Diffusers Pipelines | Diffusion Generation (T2I, T2V) | Supported | See [Diffusion model list](diffusion/index.md). |

## Day-0 Support

- NeMo AutoModel closely tracks the latest `transformers` version and updates its dependency regularly.
- New models released on the Hugging Face Hub may require the latest `transformers` version, necessitating a package upgrade.
- We are working on a CI pipeline that automatically bumps the supported `transformers` version when a new release is detected, enabling even faster day-0 support.

**Note:** To use newly released models, you may need to upgrade your NeMo AutoModel installation — just as you would upgrade `transformers` to access the latest models. AutoModel mirrors the familiar `transformers` `Auto*` APIs while adding optional performance accelerations and distributed training features.

## Custom Model Registry

NeMo AutoModel includes a custom model registry that allows teams to:

- Add custom implementations to extend support to models not yet covered upstream.
- Provide optimized or faster implementations for specific models while retaining the same AutoModel interface.

## Having Issues?

If a model from the Hub doesn't work as expected, see the [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) guide for common issues and solutions.
