# Omni Models

Omni models go beyond image-text understanding to support additional modalities such as audio, video, or a combination of all — text, image, audio, and video in a single unified model.

## Run Omni Models with NeMo AutoModel

To run omni models with NeMo AutoModel, use NeMo container version [`25.11.00`](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo-automodel?version=25.11.00) or later. If the model you want to fine-tune requires a newer version of Transformers, you may need to upgrade:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade git+git@github.com:NVIDIA-NeMo/AutoModel.git
```

For other installation options, see our [Installation Guide](../../guides/installation.md).

## Supported Models
